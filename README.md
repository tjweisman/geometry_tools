geometry_tools package
----------------------

This package consists of some basic tools for working with hyperbolic
geometry, projective geometry, and group representations. Everything is done
numerically, and a lot of the code is really sensitive to round-off error, so
don't expect to use this to verify anything deep.

Mostly, I use these tools to draw nice-ish pictures with matplotlib (and
that's probably all they're good for).
