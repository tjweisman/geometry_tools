geometry_tools package
----------------------

This package consists of some basic tools for working with hyperbolic
geometry, projective geometry, and group representations. Everything is done
numerically, and a lot of the code is really sensitive to round-off error, so
don't expect to use this to verify anything deep.

Mostly, I use these tools to draw nice-ish pictures with matplotlib (and
that's probably all they're good for).

## Installation

1. Download the package as a .zip file and extract it (or clone the repository)

2. If you have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) installed, run `pip install .` from the directory where you downloaded the repository. If you don't have pip installed, you should install pip. Or, try running `python setup.py install` from the repository directory.

3. To check that it worked, run `import geometry_tools` from a python prompt.
